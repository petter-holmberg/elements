## Searching

### Linear search

The functions in `search.h` implement algorithms based on linear search, as described in [Knuth3](#Knuth3), Chapter 6.1.

`search` and `search_not` take a range and a value that is equality-comparable with the elements of the range, stopping at the position of the first matching element, or at the limit of the range if no matching element is found.
For `search`, a match is defined as the first element `y` in the range for which the given element `x` equals `y`.
For `search_not`, a match is defined as the first element `y` in the range for which the given element `x` differs from `y`.

`search_if` and `search_if_not` take a unary predicate instead of an element.
For `search_if`, a match is defined as the first element `x` for which the given predicate is true.
For `search_not`, a match is defined as the first element `y` for which the given predicate is false.

`search_unguarded`, `search_not_unguarded`, `search_if_unguarded`, and `search_if_not_unguarded` are variations of the functions above that assume an element satisfying the applied predicate is known to exist in the given range. They take a position to the first element to be tested instead of a range as they don't need to check for the limit of the range at each iteration.

# Appendix A: On nomenclature

Concepts, types and functions in this library are named based on the following principles:

Consistency with the history and modern conventions of mathematics, in particular with computer science, is deemed more important than consistency with established names in popular programming languages. Consistency with popular programming languages is deemed more important than consistency with established names in C++.

Lexicographical ordering of names for closely related elements is deemed desirable, to facilitate searching. Multi-word names are separated by `_`.
Concepts and type functions are named with a leading upper case letter, while functions and types are all lower case.

Short names are deemed desirable, but abbreviations are generally avoided.
